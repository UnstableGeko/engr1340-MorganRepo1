The addition of integers works by considering the position of each number on a number line. You start at the position of the first integer and move the number of spots of the second integer, moving right if the second value is positive and left if negative. The resulting position is the sum of the values.

The division of integers works by imagining you have a certain number of items that you want to make groups of. So a/b would be a items split into b groups.
